2.grep -c "^$" filename = it is used to count of the emptyline in the given file
3.grep -v "^$" filename = it is used to we show the execpt empty line are given file
4.grep -n "^$" filename = it is used to findout number of where emptyline are there

1.fgrep "string 1
  >string2               =it is used to findout the multiple strings

SED implementations
 is nothing but stream editor 
 it is used to search and replace the strings

1.string replace 

   sed "s/string1/string2/g" filename             
   here string1 is old one and string 2 is new one        here dont save the records
        s=substitutin,g=globally

2. sed "s/string1/string2/g" filename                     here modify and save also

3.start of the word and end of the word are also repleaced
    sed "s/\<string1/string2/g"filename                   here records are dont save  
   if save sed -i -e "s/\<string1/string2/g"filename

4.string passed through the emptyline
   sed "s/^$/string/g"filename    it is for only show and dont save
   if have to sav sed -i -e "s/^$/string/g"filename;

5. printing cammand if you want which line
     sed -n "3p" filename
          it means 3rd line print
     sed -n "1p
            >3p" filename;
          it means 1 and 3 file only printed
     sed -n "1,3p" filename
          it means 1 to 3 lines are printed
6.delete particular digit number 
      sed "s/\<[0-9][0-9][0-9]\>//g" filename;
7.head -5 it means read top five one
8.tail -5 it means read five from bottom
9.fail -f is nothing bu to monitoring perpouse
10.simaltaneously we can see to with help  "|"

15.important operations on AWK
   
   a)To print the first item along with the row number(NR) separated with ” – “ from each line in employee
     
          $ awk '{print NR "- " $1}' employee

   b) To return the second row/item from employee

          $ awk '{print NR $2}' employee

   c) To print any non empty line if present  

          $ awk 'NF < 0' employee

   d)To find the length of the longest line present in the file:

          $ awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) } END { print max }'

   e) To count the lines in a file

          $ awk 'END { print NR }' employee

   f) Printing lines with more than 10 characters

         $ awk 'length($0) > 10' employeee

   g)To find/check for any string in any specific column

         $ awk '{ if($3 == "sales") print $0;}' employee

   h) To print the squares of first numbers from 1 to n say 6:

        $ awk 'BEGIN { for(i=1;i<=6;i++) print "square of", i, "is",i*i; }'
