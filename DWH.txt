DWh works on few functionalities those are:
A) subject oriented
B) Time_varient
c)Non-volatile
D)integrity

----------------------------------------
To process the data to DWH, we have approches like 
A) Top to bottom Approch:Ralph Kimbol: Datasource--->Staging--->Data marts--->dwh
Advantages: If any data corrupts the that particular subject will be corrupted
Disdavantage: Complexity 
B) Bottom to Top Approch:WH Inmon: Datsource--->staging--->DWH-->Datamarts
Advantage: Easy process
Disdvantage: If any data corrupts total DWH will be corrupted.

Datamart: Subset of Datawarehouse, it will be grouping the data of particular subject [sale] [customer]
DataWraehouse: Total data we will be loading directly into DWH

DMART
Dimentional Tables:
customer:
product:
Time:
Store:
sales:

Fact Tables:
Each dimetional table Key columns.
measures[Calculations]:

Q) In which tables[Dimentioan,Fact} contains the more data?
Ans: Fact table will be having more data compared to dimentional tables.
Beacuse fact table contains each and every dimentinal table key columns and their measures[calculations].

Q) which one you will build the first is it Dimentional tables or fact table?
Ans: First we will build[create] the dimentional tables and then we will build the fact tables based dimentional tables key columns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Types Of dimentions:

1) junk dimetion: miscilanious data which doesn't usefull for the calculation ex: gender, status
2)Degenerated dimentions: By default the columns  will be stored in Fact tables, but it acts as dimentonal tables. Ex: invoicenumber,
3) Role playing dimetion: it will be having multiple relationship with fact table: Time dimention                       transaction id
4)dirty dimention: miscilanious data
5) scd: scd1 , scd2, scd3:
SCD Type1: Type1 will maintain only the current data it will not maintain any history.
ex:
ashok|2000|capgemini|ban
ashok|2000|Capgemini|hyd
SCD Type2: It will maintain current data and historical data based below pre requsets.
To implement scd type2 we need to maintain few requirements[attributes]
1.surrogate key: it will generate sequence number
1|ashok|2000|capgemini|ban|2020-09-21|2021-04-13|N|0
2|ashok|2000|Capgemini|hyd|2021-04-14|9999-12-31|N|1
3|ashok|20000|Capgemini|hyd|2021-04-14|9999-12-31|Y|2

2.start date:
3.end date
4.current flag
5. version number
6)conformed dimention: The dimention tables which is having relationship with multiple fact tables. Ex. Time dimention

Scd Type3: It will maintian current data and previous data.
ashok|2000|hyd|capgemini
ashok|2000|ban|capa

ename|sal|previous_locat|current_location|company
ashok|2000|hyd|ban|capgemin
ashok|2000|ban|chennai|capgemini

--------------------------------


Types of Fact tables:
1) Additive fact:
we summarize the data in each and every dimentional table present in fact table: date,product
2)Non-Additive Facts: we can't  summed up all the dimentions present the fact table
3) Semi additive fact: we can summed up few dimentional tables but not all: sale amount
 Factless fact table: It acts as a fact but doesn't usefull for the calcultaions: attndence 
 
 --------------------------------------
 
two types of schema:

Star schema:
One fact tables surrounded by different dimentional tables
Snowflake schema:one fact table surrounded by different dimentaional tables and each dimentional interlinked another dimentional table
